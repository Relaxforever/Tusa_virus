# Tusa_virus
Django Implementation of the PSL challenge
There is a Tusavirus outbreak in Colombia. A national emergency has been declared by thegovernment. The government has requested each governor to report the number of victims intheir jurisdiction on a virtual platform.While panicking, governors could send the requested information in inconsistent formats.Some could send digits, or use their smartphoneâ€™s speech-to-text, while others will send datain the wrong format because of the sense of urgency.
# The government demands the following:
- The output of the platform should be the total of victims in the country.
- Because of government regulations, you must provide E2E tests using Seleniumor a similar framework.
- The platform must be deployed on Heroku (on a free tier) and be publiclyaccesible.
